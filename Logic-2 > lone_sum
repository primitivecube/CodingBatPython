# Logic-2 > lone_sum 

# Given 3 int values,
# a b c, 
# return their sum. 
# However, if one of the values is the same as another of the values,
# it does not count towards the sum.


# lone_sum(1, 2, 3) → 6
# lone_sum(3, 2, 3) → 2
# lone_sum(3, 3, 3) → 0

## Brett Comment: The simple way to do this would be, for each argument
## in the function, check that it is not equal to the other arguments. However,
## that would get tedious if the function accepted unlimited arguments (for example,
## a list as the argument). So, I've solved it in away that could easily extend to
## unlimited arguments. 

def lone_sum(a, b, c):
  sum_list = [a,b,c]
  sum = 0
  for i in sum_list:
    count = 0
    for j in sum_list:
      if j == i:
        count += 1
    if count == 1:
      sum += i
  return sum

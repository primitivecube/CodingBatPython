# Warmup-1 > makes10 

# Given 2 ints, a and b, return True if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.
## Brett's comment: The instruction 'if one of them is 10...' is misleading. 
## This could be understood as 'if only one of them is 10...' or as 'if either is 10...'.
## The unit test confirms that it should be read as 'if either is 10...'

# makes10(9, 10) → True
# makes10(9, 9) → False
# makes10(1, 9) → True

def makes10(a, b):
  return (a == 10 or b == 10 or a+b == 10)
